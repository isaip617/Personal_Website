							</a>
							<div class="caption">Built a website with three other programmers using Python, Flask, and HTML to allow users to input the ingredients they have in their pantry and discover what meals they can create with those ingredients, while also considering dietary restrictions such as Vegan or Gluten Free recipes. The project, named Petr's Pantry Meals, leverages the Spoonacular API to access a vast database of recipes and ingredients. By integrating this public API, we were able to fetch recipes and filter them based on the user's available ingredients. Additionally, the website considers dietary restrictions and meal preferences (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner) to provide tailored recipe suggestions. The backend logic involved parsing nested data structures from the Spoonacular API, filtering recipes by key ingredients, and further refining the results to match user-specified dietary and meal type preferences. This project showcases our ability to collaborate effectively, integrate third-party APIs, and develop user-centric web applications.</div>
